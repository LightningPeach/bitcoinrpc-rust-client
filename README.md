# Bitcoin Core RPC Client

This crate provides a Rust interface to the Bitcoin Core RPC API.

It is currently work-in-progress as not all RPC calls are implemented.

## Usage

Check `examples/` but basically, given a URL and the username/password for the node, you can construct a client and call the desired RPC method.
